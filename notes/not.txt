‚ö†Ô∏è Why this happens

When you installed packages (uvicorn, fastapi, etc.), the executables (uvicorn.exe, httpx.exe, etc.) were placed in:

C:\Users\a\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\Scripts


But that folder is not in your PATH.
So when you type uvicorn in the terminal, Windows won‚Äôt find it.

‚úÖ Fix options
Option 1: Run with Python module (no PATH change needed)

Instead of typing uvicorn ..., always run:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload


This works because Python will find uvicorn inside your environment.
üëâ Easiest and safest.
